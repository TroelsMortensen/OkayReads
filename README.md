The plan with this project is to make a desktop app, using JavaFX, which is sort of like goodreads.com.
The main point is to demonstrate how to have a main view, and sub-views can be swapped out.

A YouTube series will be available.

I have split the implementation across several branches, see overview below:
* Part 1 - The main view is in place
* Part 2 - The book overview can be opened. No functionality yet. Spend too much time trying to git panes to fit in size :(
* Part 3 - The search view. No functionality, just opening the search view and passing arguments.
